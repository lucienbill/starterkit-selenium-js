## What?
Selenium is awesome: it allows you to interact with a browser with code!
Do you want to automate some tests on the UI of your app?
You can do just that!
Do you need to automate a process for an app that doesn't provide a nice API?
You can do that too!

But...
Selenium is not exactly trivial to learn!
This repo contains some code that can be helpful if you are beginning with Selenium.

Start by reading the `package.json` file, then read the code of the runnable target(s).
